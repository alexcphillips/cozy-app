 * than holding them, so one ring can be in several; an item that has since
 * left the inventory is skipped when the loadout is worn.
 *
 * The loadout last worn or saved is the active one, and changing gear on the
 * character screen updates it. Switching works anywhere but mid-Run.
 *
 * Auto-swap wears the loadout tagged for an activity as that activity starts
 * (a fight, a cast), so fishing then fighting swaps gear and back without a
 * tap. For skills (fishing) it's free; for combat it's a bought upgrade, as
 * are more loadout slots.
