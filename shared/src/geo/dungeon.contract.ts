/**
 * Dungeons: raid-style boss fights, gathered for in lobbies.
 *
 * A POI is a lobby entrance. Every POI opens the same worldwide list of open
 * lobbies, so a lobby never says where anyone is. Creating or joining one
 * needs you at a POI; once in, you can walk off and still be taken along.
 *
 * A lobby has no countdown: it waits until the host starts it, and starting
 * takes everyone in at once. A host who walks off and closes the app doesn't
 * leave it up forever: it closes once they've been gone
 * GEO_DUNGEON_HOST_AWAY_SECONDS. For now each player gets their own solo Run
 * against the boss; shared multiplayer Runs come later. A dungeon Run is
 * fought at full health and leaves the player's own health (GeoHealth) as it
 * was, win or lose; food eaten and coins lost to a defeat still count.
