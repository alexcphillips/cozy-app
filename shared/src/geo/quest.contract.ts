/**
 * Quests: a player's active quests and how far along each one is.
 *
 * The server counts progress (a kill, a catch, an item gathered) and writes
 * each objective's label, so a new kind of objective needs no app change: the
 * app draws `label (current/target)`. When every objective is met the quest is
 * `ready` and waits to be turned in for its reward; claimed quests leave the
 * list.
 *
 * Not served yet: the app shows dev samples until the quest system is built.
